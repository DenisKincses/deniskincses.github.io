      <h4>list goes from oldest to newest</h4>
      <h4>- iphone 3gs (201x, "first ever phone, i liked it very much, had so many games on it, but it was getting old so i needed a newer, supported phone")</h4>
      <h4>- allview p5 energy (2015, "this phone was bought from a guy in my city, battery good but low performance, especially on youtube")</h4>
      <h4>- sony xperia x (2017, "phone was bought as a gift from my aunt, somehow the first days of owning it i got a virus without even downloading anything, but i had many funs playing with the AR and the camera")</h4>
      <h4>- huawei p smart 2019 (2019, "i remember saying to my mom that i needed a newer phone since all the new phones now have those notches and no bezels on them, so we bought this, but unfortunatly it didn't have any AR support and then i told my mom that i wanted another phone so that i can play minecraft earth, and like no support for google play services in the future")</h4>
      <h4>- xiaomi redmi note 8 pro (2020, "i was very lucky to get this phone, not only the cameras were very good, i finally got my AR functionality back! old hardware, sure, but it was very good at the time")</h4>
      <h4>- xiaomi redmi note 11 pro 5g (2022, "i think we bought this phone because the note 8 pro was getting discontinued? i'm not really sure why we bought this, it was somewhat worser with only slightly newer inside hardware")</h4>
      <h4>- xiaomi 11t pro (2023, "we bought this one off of an website to try it out and my mom sent it back immediatly 'cause the phone overheated when it was charging, the chipset, snapdragon 888 5g, was notoriously famous for its overheating problems, but then again we were lucky to sell it since it was kind of old")</h4>
      <h4>- xiaomi poco f5 pro (2023, "i was indesicive if i wanted to buy the poco f5 pro, or poco f5, but since i had the money for both i thought why not and buy the poco f5 pro, i know i keep saying but i was very lucky to buy this phone, im usually not good at getting phones as you can see, but this time i'm actually happy with my phone and i think i will keep it until it's very outdated")
      <h4>- iphone se 1st generation (2024, "i wanted an iphone for a long time because of its one feature: imessage (and a little bit of jailbreaking). i didnt want to use the iphone for anything else like social media or using its os for some unrelated reasons, but i was at a flea market and saw an iphone se 1st gen being sold for a cheap price, and i just bought it, luckily it didn't have icloud lock either i was lucky)</h4> 
      </h4>
      <h4>i don't think i'll ever buy phones from xiaomi though, i've seen the software and it's very bloated with useless apps, i really want to switch over to nothing phones, since their design, inside (software) and outside (hardware) looks very nice for me in my opinion, i've been more privacy focused too so for me to get a very "barebones" android looking system would be very nice</h4>
      <h4>test</h4>
