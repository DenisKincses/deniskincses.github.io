[Intro: itchyluff as Tyler, The Creator]
...Yah'

Pickle, Pickle Rick,
I'm a pickle, pickle dick
Pick-a-ling my pickle, like a chickle,
Pickle, Pickle Rick. 

(...Yah')

(Pickle, Pickle Rick,)
(I'm a pickle, pickle dick)
(Pick-a-ling my pickle, like a chickle,)
(Pickle, Pickle Rick.)

[Verse]
Chromakopia, green, uh, like Pickle Rick,
Chromekopia, I've got a cold, I'm crazy sick,
Mocha Starbuck', coffee, hot brown drink,
Coffee, coffee, coffee, I need to think my coffee.

[Pre-Chrorus]
(Pi-ckle Rick had co...)
Yeah, yeah, Pickle Rick, you motherfucker,
(Pi-ckle Rick had co...)
Yeah, yeah, Pickle Rick, you motherfucker,

[Chorus]
Everyone is say', "Hey Tyler, drop music",
Well, I dropped music, here is my music,
"Bah-bah-bah, bah, bah-bah-bah, bah-buh,
Bah-buh-buh, buh-baa, bi-ri-rum, bum-bah-duh,
Bah-bah-bah, bah, bah-bah-bah, bah-buh,
Bah-buh-buh, buh-baa, bi-ri-rum, bum-bah-duh",

[Verse]
I'm droppin' these bars, like money on food,
On food, I'm hungry, I'm hungry for food,
Chromakopia reminds me of cornucopia, 
Fruit of the Loom, of the Loom, of the Loom.

[Chorus]
Chromakopia, Christmas, ho-ho,
Recieving from the list, presents, ho-ho
Snowy house, big chimney,
Fireplace', or a candy cane.

(Chromakopia, Christmas, ho-ho,)
(Recieving from the list, presents, ho-ho)
(Snowy house, big chimney,)
(Fireplace', or a candy cane.)

[Bridge]
Krel-ma-krel-pia...
Chro-ma-ko-pi-a...

[Outro]
Pickle, Pickle Rick,
I'm a pickle, pickle dick
Pick-a-ling my pickle, like a chickle,
Pickle, Pickle Rick. 

(...Yah')

(Pickle, Pickle Rick,)
(I'm a pickle, pickle dick)
(Pick-a-ling my pickle, like a chickle,)
(Pickle, Pickle Rick.)
