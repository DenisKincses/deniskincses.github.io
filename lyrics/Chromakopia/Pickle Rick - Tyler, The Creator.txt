Pickle, Pickle Rick,
I'm a pickle, pickle dick
Pick-a-ling my pickle, like a chickle,
Pickle, Pickle Rick. 

(...Yah')

(Pickle, Pickle Rick,)
(I'm a pickle, pickle dick)
(Pick-a-ling my pickle, like a chickle,)

Chromakopia, green, uh, like Pickle Rick,
Chromekopia, I've got a cold, I'm crazy sick,
Mocha Starbuck', coffee, hot brown drink,
Coffee, coffee, coffee, I need to think my coffee.

Yeah, yeah, Pickle Rick, you motherfucker,

Yeah, yeah, Pickle Rick, you motherfucker,

Everyone is say', "Hey Tyler, drop music",
Well, I dropped music, here is my music,
"Bah-bah-bah, bah, bah-bah-bah, bah-buh,
Bah-buh-buh, buh-baa, bi-ri-rum, bum-bah-duh,
Bah-bah-bah, bah, bah-bah-bah, bah-buh,
Bah-buh-buh, buh-baa, bi-ri-rum, bum-bah-duh",

I'm droppin' these bars, like money on food,
On food, I'm hungry, I'm hungry for food,
Chromakopia reminds me of cornucopia, 
Fruit of the Loom, of the Loom, of the Loom.

Chromakopia, Christmas, ho-ho,
Recieving from the list, presents, ho-ho
Snowy house, big chimney,
Fireplace', or a candy cane.

(Chromakopia, Christmas, ho-ho,)
